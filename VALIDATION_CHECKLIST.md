  - [x] Added multi-select `st.multiselect` for defensive assets
  - [x] Default: ["BIL", "TLT"] with intelligent fallback
  - [x] Added slider for `max_drawdown_allocation` (10-100%, default 30%)
  - [x] Added help text for both controls

- [x] **Function Signature Updates:**
  - [x] Updated `backtest_strategies()` to accept new parameters
  - [x] Updated regime detection custom function to use new parameters
  - [x] All `backtest_strategies()` calls pass new parameters

- [x] **Session State Management:**
  - [x] Updated `st.session_state['hrp_settings']` to include:
    - [x] `defensive_assets`
    - [x] `max_drawdown_allocation`
    - [x] `drawdown_threshold`
    - [x] `regime_vol_mult`
  - [x] Updated `st.session_state['regime_settings']` to include same parameters

## ✅ PDF Report Generation

- [x] **Settings Page (Page 1):**
  - [x] Added "REGIME-AWARE SETTINGS:" section
  - [x] Display defensive assets list
  - [x] Display max drawdown allocation percentage
  - [x] Display drawdown threshold
  - [x] Display regime volatility multiplier

- [x] **Regime-Aware Analysis Page (Page 4):**
  - [x] Enhanced grid layout to accommodate new content
  - [x] Added strategy explanation section
  - [x] Shows defensive assets configuration
  - [x] Shows allocation percentages during drawdown
  - [x] Shows remaining allocation to risky assets
  - [x] Shows regime detection parameters
  - [x] Added visual styling with background box

- [x] **Report Settings Passed Correctly:**
  - [x] HRP backtest report passes all settings
  - [x] Regime-Aware backtest report passes all settings
  - [x] Combined report passes all settings

## ✅ Code Quality

- [x] No syntax errors detected
- [x] No undefined variables
- [x] All imports available
- [x] Backward compatibility considerations documented
- [x] Error handling for edge cases

## ✅ Logic Validation

- [x] Defensive assets distributed equally
  - Formula: `defensive_weight = max_drawdown_allocation / len(defensive_assets)`
  
- [x] Risky assets scaled proportionally
  - Formula: `risky_allocation = 1.0 - max_drawdown_allocation`
  - Each risky asset gets: `base_weight * (risky_allocation / sum_of_risky_base_weights)`

- [x] Edge cases handled:
  - [x] No defensive assets specified → scales down all assets by max_drawdown_allocation
  - [x] All assets are defensive → works correctly
  - [x] Empty returns → fallback to equal weights
  - [x] Invalid defensive assets → filtered out

## ✅ Features Working

### During NORMAL Regime:
- [x] Portfolio uses base HRP weights
- [x] Regime weights = final weights
- [x] No defensive shift applied

### During DRAWDOWN Regime:
- [x] Allocates `max_drawdown_allocation / num_defensive_assets` to each defensive asset
- [x] Remaining allocation scales risky assets proportionally
- [x] Weights sum to 1.0
- [x] All weights non-negative

### Backtest Integration:
- [x] Rebalancing occurs with new parameters
- [x] Regime detection respects custom multipliers
- [x] HRP and Regime-Aware strategies both use new logic
- [x] Performance metrics calculated correctly

### PDF Report:
- [x] Settings displayed correctly
- [x] Strategy explanation visible and readable
- [x] All defensive assets listed
- [x] Allocation percentages accurate
- [x] Report generates without errors

## ✅ User Experience

- [x] Multi-select is intuitive
- [x] Slider is easy to adjust
- [x] Defaults are sensible
- [x] Help text is clear
- [x] Report explains strategy
- [x] Portfolio behavior is transparent

## Test Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Standard Configuration
- Defensive Assets: ["TLT", "GLD"]
- Max Allocation: 30%
- Base HRP: SPY 40%, QQQ 30%, IWM 15%, EEM 10%, TLT 3%, GLD 2%

**Expected Drawdown Allocation:**
- TLT: 15%
- GLD: 15%
- SPY: ~28% (40% × 70% / 70%)
- QQQ: ~21% (30% × 70% / 70%)
- IWM: ~10.5% (15% × 70% / 70%)
- EEM: ~7% (10% × 70% / 70%)
- BIL: ~3.5% (5% × 70% / 70%)

### Scenario 2: Conservative Configuration
- Defensive Assets: ["TLT", "GLD", "BIL"]
- Max Allocation: 50%
- Should allocate ~16.67% to each defensive asset

### Scenario 3: Aggressive Configuration
- Defensive Assets: ["GLD"]
- Max Allocation: 10%
- GLD: 10%, Remaining risky assets: 90%

### Scenario 4: No Defensive Assets
- Defensive Assets: []
- Max Allocation: 30% (ignored)
- Should scale all assets down by 30%
