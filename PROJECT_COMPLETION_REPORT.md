## 🏗️ Architecture Changes

### Backend (hrp_functions.py)
```
OLD:
  defensive_asset: str = None  ❌
  Result: 100% allocation to single asset

NEW:
  defensive_assets: list = None ✅
  max_drawdown_allocation: float = 0.30 ✅
  Result: Flexible allocation across multiple assets
```

### Frontend (app.py)
```
OLD:
  st.selectbox() ❌
  Single asset only

NEW:
  st.multiselect() ✅
  Multiple assets supported
  
OLD:
  100% allocation (fixed) ❌

NEW:
  10-100% allocation (user-configurable) ✅
```

### Reports (PDF Generation)
```
OLD:
  Basic settings page ❌

NEW:
  Enhanced settings page ✅
  + Detailed regime-aware strategy section ✅
```
