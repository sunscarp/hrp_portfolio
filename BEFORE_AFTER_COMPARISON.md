# Before & After Comparison: Regime-Aware Drawdown Logic

## OLD IMPLEMENTATION (Single Asset Allocation)

### Code Structure
```python
# OLD: regime_aware_hrp_with_drawdown()
def regime_aware_hrp_with_drawdown(returns, 
                                   detect_fn=None,
                                   defensive_asset: str = None,  # ‚Üê Single asset
                                   **kwargs):
    
    if drawdown_control and current_regime == 'drawdown':
        if defensive_asset is not None:
            # Allocate 100% to defensive asset
            final_w = pd.Series(0.0, index=tickers)
            final_w[defensive_asset] = 1.0  # ‚Üê ALL IN ONE ASSET
```

### UI Configuration (OLD)
```python
# OLD: app.py sidebar
defensive_asset = st.sidebar.selectbox(
    "Select defensive asset (for drawdown regime):",
    options=["None"] + selected_assets,
    index=(selected_assets.index("BIL")+1) if "BIL" in selected_assets else 0
)
if defensive_asset == "None":
    defensive_asset = None
```

### Portfolio Behavior (OLD)
**Scenario:** SPY 40%, QQQ 30%, TLT 20%, GLD 10%, defensive_asset=GLD

**During DRAWDOWN:**
- Portfolio becomes: **100% GLD**
- SPY: 0% | QQQ: 0% | TLT: 0% | GLD: 100%
- ‚ùå Complete sector rotation, loses diversification
- ‚ùå Single-asset risk concentration

## NEW IMPLEMENTATION (Multi-Asset Defensive Portfolio)

### Code Structure
```python
# NEW: regime_aware_hrp_with_drawdown()
def regime_aware_hrp_with_drawdown(returns,
                                   detect_fn=None,
                                   defensive_assets: list = None,  # ‚Üê Multiple assets
                                   max_drawdown_allocation: float = 0.30,  # ‚Üê Control allocation %
                                   **kwargs):
    
    if drawdown_control and current_regime == 'drawdown':
        final_w = pd.Series(0.0, index=tickers)
        
        if defensive_assets and len(defensive_assets) > 0:
            # Equal-weight the defensive assets
            defensive_weight = max_drawdown_allocation / len(defensive_assets)
            for asset in defensive_assets:
                final_w[asset] = defensive_weight  # ‚Üê DISTRIBUTED ALLOCATION
            
            # Remaining allocation to risky assets (scaled)
            risky_allocation = 1.0 - max_drawdown_allocation
            risky_assets = [a for a in tickers if a not in defensive_assets]
            
            if risky_assets and risky_allocation > 0:
                risky_weights = regime_w[risky_assets].copy()
                risky_weights = risky_weights / risky_weights.sum()
                risky_weights = risky_weights * risky_allocation
                final_w[risky_assets] = risky_weights  # ‚Üê PROPORTIONAL SCALING
```

### UI Configuration (NEW)
```python
# NEW: app.py sidebar
defensive_assets_selected = st.sidebar.multiselect(
    "Select defensive assets (for drawdown regime):",
    options=selected_assets,
    default=["BIL", "TLT"] if "BIL" in selected_assets and "TLT" in selected_assets else [],
    help="Assets to allocate to during drawdown regime (e.g., bonds, gold, cash)."
)

max_drawdown_allocation = st.sidebar.slider(
    "Max allocation to defensive assets during drawdown (%):",
    min_value=10,
    max_value=100,
    value=30,
    step=5,
    help="Maximum percentage of portfolio to allocate to defensive assets when in drawdown regime."
)
max_drawdown_allocation = max_drawdown_allocation / 100
```

### Portfolio Behavior (NEW)
**Scenario:** SPY 40%, QQQ 30%, TLT 20%, GLD 10%, defensive_assets=[TLT, GLD], max_drawdown_allocation=30%

**During DRAWDOWN:**
- Portfolio becomes: TLT 15% + GLD 15% + (70% of risky assets scaled)
  - TLT: 15% (defensive)
  - GLD: 15% (defensive)
  - SPY: 40% √ó 0.70 / 70% = 28%
  - QQQ: 30% √ó 0.70 / 70% = 21%
  - BIL: 10% √ó 0.70 / 70% = 7%

- ‚úÖ Maintains diversification (5 assets instead of 1)
- ‚úÖ Controlled defensive shift (only 30%, not 100%)
- ‚úÖ Risk is spread across multiple defensive assets
- ‚úÖ Risky assets still get 70% of portfolio

## Migration Notes

### For Existing Users:
1. ‚ö†Ô∏è Old setting `defensive_asset="GLD"` ‚Üí New: `defensive_assets=["GLD"]`
2. ‚úÖ Old allocation 100% ‚Üí New default: 30% (more conservative)
